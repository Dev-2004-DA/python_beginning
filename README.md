# Python Learning Journal

This repository contains my daily learning progress as I go through Python fundamentals and descriptive statistics â€” part of my M.Sc. job-ready skill-building plan.

---

### âœ… Day 1: Python Setup & Syntax
- Practiced: `print()`, `input()`, `type()`, type conversions (`int`, `float`, `complex`, `str`)
- Learned how to:
  - Use `.split()` with `input()`
  - Convert between data types
  - Use comments for documentation

---

### âœ… Day 2: Data Structures â€“ Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- Practiced:
  - List operations (`append`, `pop`, `sort`, slicing)
  - Tuple immutability
  - Set properties (no duplicates, basic set operations)
  - Dictionary creation, key-value pairs, `get()`, `update()`, `keys()`, `values()`
- Learned differences between these structures and where to use them

---

### âœ… Day 3: Conditional Statements
- Practiced:
  - `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
  - Nested conditions
  - Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Built small programs using conditional logic (e.g., grading system, eligibility check)

---

### âœ… Day 4: Loops â€“ `for` and `while`
- Practiced:
  - `for` loop with `range()`
  - Iterating over strings and lists
  - `while` loop with exit conditions
  - Control statements: `break`, `continue`, `pass`
- Wrote mini-examples like printing patterns, list search, sum calculator

---

### âœ… Day 5: Functions
- Practiced:
  - Creating and calling functions using `def`
  - Using parameters and `return` values

- Wrote modular functions for repeated tasks

---

### âœ… Day 6: Random ,Math &  Statistics Modules (Additional)
- Practiced:
  - `math` module: `sqrt`, `floor`, `ceil`, `pow`, `factorial`, `pi`
  - `statistics` module: `mean`, `median`, `mode`, `variance`, `stdev`, `pvariance`, `pstdev`
- Used both modules in practice scripts to perform calculations and summaries

---

### âœ… Day 7: Mini Project â€“ Descriptive Statistics Tool

This project analyzes a list of numbers entered by the user and outputs key descriptive statistics using only built-in modules (`statistics`, `math`).

#### ðŸ§  Features:
- Count, Mean, Median, Mode(s)
- Min, Max, Range
- Population & Sample Variance and Standard Deviation
- Quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3), IQR
- Outlier detection using 1.5Ã—IQR rule

#### ðŸ“¦ Python Concepts Used:
- `input()`, lists, loops, conditionals, and custom functions
- Built-in modules: `math`, `statistics`
