# Python Learning Journal

This repository contains my daily learning progress as I go through Python fundamentals and descriptive statistics.

### âœ… Day 1: Python Setup & Syntax
- Practiced: `print()`, `input()`, `type()`, type conversions (`int`, `float`, `complex`, `str`)
- Learned how to:
  - Use `.split()` with `input()`
  - Convert between data types
  - Use comments for documentation
